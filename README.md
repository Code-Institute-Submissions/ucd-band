   Milestone Project Band by Derek Dhammaloka
   
   My aim is to provide a website for The Monkees, which was a 1960s Rock Band.
   
   4 web pages - Home, Gallery, News and Events.
   
   The Home Page gives details of the contents.
   
   The Gallery Page provides the images of The Monkees.
   
   Responsive Image Gallery was applied to all the images.  When the image was clicked, the full size of the image was on
   another tab.
   
   Hovering the image, gives an orange border.  Otherwise a charcoal border.  Images and descriptions centered.
   
   Resizing the width of the browser window, automatically adjusts the height of each image.
   
   Horizontal Rules (1 px solid black) according to Album, Band and Covers.
   
   Media Queries were applied according to the width of the browser (80% width for screens between 201px and 700px), otherwise 20% width.
