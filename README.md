   Milestone Project Band by Derek Dhammaloka
   
   My aim is to provide a website for The Monkees, which was a 1960s Rock Band.
   
   4 web pages - Home, Gallery, News and Events.
   
   The Home Page gives details of the contents.
   
   The Gallery Page provides the images of The Monkees.
   
   Responsive Image Gallery was applied to all the images.  When the image was clicked, the full size of the image was on
   another tab.
   
   Hovering the image, gives an orange border.  Otherwise a charcoal border.  Images and descriptions centered.
   
   Resizing the width of the browser window, automatically adjusts the height of each image.
   
   Horizontal Rules (1 px solid black) according to Album, Band and Covers.
   
   Media Queries were applied according to the width of the browser.

   There is also a PDF File of Events to Download for a full details of events.  The event fields are date, event description and venue.
   The event description includes Christmas Parties, Weddings and Balls.  Venues include hotels, pubs or anything licenced for music.
   
   The News Page has details of the latest news and audio clips.
   
   Testing - made sure all the links (including Social Media) went to the correct pages.
   
   Made sure the videos and audios were run as intended.  If the browser did not support video or audio, display the message
   'Your browser does not support video or audio tag'.
