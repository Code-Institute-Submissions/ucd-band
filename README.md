# User Centric Development (Band)
   
The aim of this project is to provide a website for The Monkees, which was a 1960s Rock Band.
This includes news, events and the gallery.  Links to Social Media (Facebook, Twitter and YouTube) are provided on every page.

## UX

Users can be individuals who want to show an interest of The Monkees.  They are able to view the upcoming events in a table
or they can download a full schedule of events in the form of a PDF File.  Once it has been downloaded, it can be printed out.

They are able to view the news as well as the images.

They can visit the Facebook Pages, Twitter Pages and YouTube Channel without leaving The Monkees website.  When the user has hovered on the social link,
a tooltip (e.g. YouTube) is displayed to let the browser know that he/she has hovered over the social link.

Wireframes are supplied in the wireframes folder.  Files are index.png, news.png, gallery.png and events.png.  Every file has
the desktop and mobile versions.

Information Architecture is supplied in the documentation folder.  The file is information-architecture.pdf.  A tree structure is provided.

All external links (e.g. Facebook) will open in a new tab using target="_blank".
